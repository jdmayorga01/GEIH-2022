## Objetive

The objective of this project is to analyze the labor market of specific vulnerable populations (migrants and disabled persons) using administrative data from the Colombian labor market survey *"La Gran Encuesta Integrada de Hogares"* (GEIH) in October 2022. GEIH produces information at the national, urban-rural level and for the thirteen main cities and metropolitan areas. This is a self-weighting, multistage, stratified, unequal cluster, probability sampling survey [(more information on GEIH)](https://www.dane.gov.co/index.php/estadisticas-por-tema/mercado-laboral/empleo-y-desempleo/geih-historicos). GEIH survey is divided into nine modules, including *sociodemographic characteristics, employment, unemployment, and migration, among others*. The master data shared for this code sample only includes three modules (General characteristics, employment, and migration) since the data folder is very large. These modules provide rich information about employment status, wages, as well as education level, gender, and other sociodemographic data.
